# stopwatch

A simple practice project I wanted to make to practice the very basics of flutter. 

The spec is

A stop watch timer showing hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds. 
Functionality start, stop, record & clear. 

The record button should add to a list of recorded times below the stop watch. 

The clear button should clear the list. 

All data is stored locally in state.
